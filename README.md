# QR Code Generator

## Overview

This project is a simple QR code generator application built with Python's `tkinter` library for the graphical user interface and `pyqrcode` for QR code generation. The application allows users to input text and generate a corresponding QR code, which is then displayed in the application window.

## Files

### `main.py`

This script creates a GUI application for generating and displaying QR codes.

#### Dependencies

- `pyqrcode`: For generating QR codes.
- `tkinter`: For creating the GUI.

#### Functions

**`generateQR()`**

- Generates a QR code based on the text entered in the input field.
- Displays the generated QR code in the application window.
- Shows a message box if the input field is empty.

**`showcode()`**

- Updates the GUI to show the generated QR code and a label indicating the QR code's content.

**`clearALL()`**

- Clears the text input field and resets the focus.

#### GUI Components

- **Text Entry Field**: For entering the text to be converted into a QR code.
- **Generate Button**: Triggers the QR code generation process.
- **Clear Button**: Clears the text input field.
- **Image Label**: Displays the generated QR code.
- **Status Label**: Displays the text content for which the QR code was generated.

#### How to Run

1. Ensure you have the required libraries installed:
    ```bash
    pip install pyqrcode
    ```

2. Run the script to start the QR code generator application:
    ```bash
    python main.py
    ```

3. Enter text into the input field and click the "Generate" button to create and display the QR code.
4. Click the "Clear" button to reset the input field.

#### Notes

- The application window is configured with a light green background and a size of 600x100 pixels.
